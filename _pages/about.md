## About Me
I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronics Engineering at National Chiao Tung University. During my four years in college, I found my interest in the fields of information theory, wireless communication, signal processing, and machine learning. As a result, I took most graduate-level courses available and receive top 1% in all of them. I did three research topics during my undergraduate research, varying from meta learning to deep learning based video signal processing. In June 2021, I graduated as a second-place student in our class. After graduating, I serve as a full-time research assistant in [Professor Chen-Yi Lee's](http://www.si2lab.org/faculty/) lab. Currently, I have one published paper on European Conference on Computer Vision 2020 and two submitted papers on IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2022.


## Projects
### Remote Heart Rate Estimation
The project aims to detect heart rate from facial videos. We use a deep neural network combine with a Meta-Transductive Learner to construct an robust end-to-end heart rate estimation system. This project was in cooperation with Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
### Foveat-based Video Super Resolution
This project aims to perform super resolution onto a low resolution video stream with the information of where the user's foveat region is. Given a streaming data flow including low resolution frames and high resolution fovea regions, we apply a dynamic convolution approach to extract the moving fovea region's information for the peripheral's super resolution.
### Video Prediction
A hierarchical memory structure cascaded onto LSTM that is used for video frame prediction. The performance of this approach successfully outperforms current SotA of this field.
### Context Aware Machine Learning
Most neural networks are designed to be a set of static weights that can fit a certain data distribution. This usually cause problems when facing real-world data that are noisy or far from training data's distribution. We are trying to use concepts of self-supervised learning, capsules, attention and dynamic convolutional neural networks to derive a robust and general method to take advantage of context stored in data points.
